<p >My name is Xavier. I am a student that is enrolled in a coding boot camp. This is my
    first demo Portfolio that I am making
    personally, I like to be creative and since there is so much today technology wise that we can do we can create so many things as long as we have the will to do so 
       I like to draw,bake,cook,video edit, play a piano and violin. There is so much
    more I like to do and if your still curious I would suggest to meet me in person. 
    Due to my love for creativity this is what actually lead me into something a love 
      web developing. <br>To give you background, before I grew to not only love coding and 
     to further  my knowledge in this profession I was completely clueless.
     To put prospective on my cluelessness; during jr high, one of my teachers had us
    send an assignment to her through email. 
    
    <br>Unfortunately, I did not have a single clue on how to easily load in a file from a 
    flash drive and copy it on one note and send it through an email.
    If I could barely figure out how to do that I would have never thought of getting 
    where I am at today. This love did not really hit me, until I was about 15 or 16 in age. I took online 
    school through out my high school years.This online school helped me to become more adequate in the tech industry today
    due to all the electives they offered. Once, I graduated I made it my goal to focus my studies on a career that I love.
